# jmeter-graphs

## Description
A utility to graph from JMeter CSV logs. The currently supported graphs are response times, requests per second and throughput per second.

### Example Graphs
* [Response times](./examples/sample-response-times.png)
* [Requests per second]( ./examples/sample-requests.png)
* [Throughput per second]( ./examples/sample-throughput.png)

## JMeter Set-up
Create a JMeter listener and enter a filepath in the edit box labelled, "Write results to file". I use the Aggegrate Report listener and input './aggregate-report.csv'.

You can use the default log configuration, but the prerequisites are that the epoch time and elapsed time are in the first and second columns respectively, a header is not used and the logs are in CSV format. 

```log
1406193755956,202, ...
```

## Installation and Example Run
```bash 
$ git clone git@github.com:AidyLewis/jmeter-graphs.git
$ cd bin
$ java -jar jmeter-graphs-0.1.0.jar "response" "../test/jmeter_graphs/fixtures/aggregate-report.csv" "20rps"
$ java -jar jmeter-graphs-0.1.0.jar "requests" "../test/jmeter_graphs/fixtures/aggregate-report.csv"
$ java -jar jmeter-graphs-0.1.0.jar "throughput" "../test/jmeter_graphs/fixtures/aggregate-report.csv"
```
This is a standalone executable jar and can be placed anywhere on your filesystem.

## Implementation 

### Calculations

* **Response Times** => Direct reading of epoch and elapsed times
* **Requests per second** => Grouped and counted the number of samples per second 
* **Throughput per second** => Similar method to requests per second, but added epoch times to the elapsed time

### Graphing Library
I have used Clojure's [Incanter](https://github.com/incanter/incanter) as a graphing library.

## Questions
**Why is my throughput per second sometimes greater than my requests per second?**

JMeter has a constant throughput timer that fixes requests per minute. We can assure 20 requests per second(rps) with
(* 60 20) => 1200. 

We cannot assure a fixed throughput (+ epoch-times elapsed-times) as elapsed time is variable. At 20rps we may have a throughput of 15 for one second and 25 the subsequent second. 

Running the below function through a Clojure REPL:
```clojure
(throughput-dataset "test/jmeter_graphs/fixtures/aggregate-report.csv")
````

Will give us an Incanter dataset:
```log
| 1406194240000 |         20 |
| 1406194241000 |         20 |
| 1406194242000 |         15 |
| 1406194243000 |         25 |
| 1406194244000 |         20 |
```

Which show us the time period the throughput per second occurred. In one second we have 15, whilst the next second returns 25. 

##TODO
* Change 'test duration' to 'standard time'
* hard-code response header
* pluralise 'response'
* Remove string from graph name in command line parameters 
* average times every x period to get rid of spikes.
* filter non-http response codes from throughput and responses
* graph response codes
* throughput axis is has the word "throughout"
